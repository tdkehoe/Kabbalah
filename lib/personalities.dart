Number one is associated with the Sun, ruler of the sign Leo. The nature of a number can often be discerned by studying words that contain the name of its associated planet or luminary, in this case the Sun. If we say that someone has a sunny personality, we mean that the person is naturally happy and optimistic. Words such as solitude, solitary, sole and solo contain the word Sol, an ancient name for the Sun, and these words provide us with further clues to the meaning of the number 1. People with this number are self-starters who make decisions and take action on their own -- solo. They trust their own judgment far more than that of others, and are certain that their own decisions will bear fruit. They are leaders rather than followers. It is appropriate that the words solitude and solitary contain the name Sol, for a true leader is necessarily alone ("It's lonely at the top") because his or her vision is unique.To lead, one must answer only to oneself.

The One personality is proud, warm, generous, and magnanimous. Such people love to entertain and to be the centre of attention. They are often wonderfully amusing storytellers with a real sense of drama. They often rise to positions of prominence because of their natural ability to lead.

Ones are passionate lovers. They expect appreciation for their prowess and will stray without it. They sometimes have a bit of a harem mentality, believing that they deserve more than one lover. The men value highly good looks in a woman (more so than most men). Their pride is easily hurt and must be nurtured. They require respect and admiration, and they will not settle for less. A show of appreciation will bring out their benevolent nature.

People with the number one believe that their opinions are completely correct, and anyone whose opinions differ is simply mistaken. They expect everybody to agree with them, to share their tastes, and to live their lives following their example. They are unswerving in their views and love to lecture people who have different beliefs or priorities.

Ones can benefit from wearing yellow stones or crystals and gold next to the body.

Chakra: Solar Plexus
Gems/Stones: Amber, topaz, citrine, yellow garnet (topazolite, grossular), golden beryl, yellow chrysoberyl

Number two is associated with the Moon, ruler of the sign Cancer. The nature of a number can often be discerned by studying words that contain the name of its associated planet or luminary, in this case the Moon. The words lunacy, lunatic and luny are derived from the word Luna, an ancient name for the Moon. This does not mean that Twos are crazy, but they are unpredictable because of their changing moods (although you might come to predict their moods if you pay attention to the position of the Moon in the zodiac from day to day). They are particularly susceptible to the phases of the Moon, being even more energized by the new moon and full moon than the rest of us. When the right mood hits them, they have a truly luny sense of humour that delights those close to them.

Twos are motherly in nature, bestowing care upon their family and friends. They love to nurture, sometimes with food, sometimes with hugs and kind words. They are usually gentle and caring. They have a love of home and family, partially because of the security that comes from having a place to nest and loved ones nearby. They need a feeling of security to "ground" them and stabilize their naturally unstable moods. People with the number two have a tendency to worry, which can lead to ulcers if unchecked. They are emotionally sensitive and easily hurt, leading to melancholy. They often lack confidence and need encouragement from loved ones. To protect themselves from hurt, they sometimes retreat into a shell, becoming quiet, secretive, and crabby. They can be coaxed out of the shell only by sincere gestures of affection and reassurance of sensitivity to their needs. They are possessive of friends, lovers, and children.

People with the number two are thrifty and save their money; having a "nest egg" gives them a sense of security. They are cautious, sometimes even fearful, and hate taking chances. They must learn to trust more and worry less, for negative thinking can prevent them from realizing their dreams. They are intuitive and wonderfully imaginative, and should use this to their advantage.

Twos can benefit from wearing silvery or white stones or crystals and silver next to the body.

Colours: Silver, white, pale yellow, pale green
Chakras: Solar Plexus, heart
Gems/Stones: Pearls, moonstones, opals
Crystals: Any white or pale yellow ones, for example forms of calcite, danburite, anhydrite, colemanite, pyrophyllite, lawsonite, cryolite, and fluorite
Metals: Silver

Number three is associated with the planet Jupiter, ruler of the sign Sagittarius. The nature of a number can often be discerned by studying words that contain the name of its associated planet or luminary, in this case Jupiter. The word jovial is derived from the word Jove, an ancient name for Jupiter. This suggests that the number three person is good- natured, easy-going, and joyous. Such people are candid and straightforward with a lack of inhibition and a great freedom of expression, much like small children in this way. Threes value their personal freedom highly, and will not be restricted in any way. They must do things their way, even at the expense of offending others. "Don't fence me in" is their motto. They often remain bachelors or bachelorettes in order to preserve their sense of freedom.

Threes need constant expansion of their knowledge and experience, and so they are often attracted to travel and higher education. Some become perpetual students, acquiring several degrees. They tend to overextend themselves; they might, for example, spend money a little too freely and acquire unnecessary possessions. Threes are often self-indulgent, unable to restrain themselves. They may be attracted to law, religion, or philosophy. People with the number three are natural athletes, and find great joy in physical activity.

Threes are great optimists; they are not the type to worry or fear potential dangers. Their behaviour often strikes others as irresponsible or imprudent, but their failure to calculate the consequences of an action rarely works against them, for things usually work out well for them. Their lives are generally very fortunate.

Threes can benefit from wearing purple stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Turquoise green, purple, mauve, violet, wine red
Chakras: Crown of the head, base of the spine
Gems/Stones: Amethyst, turquoise, tanzanite (zoisite)
Crystals: Any purple ones, for example amethyst and forms offluorite, apatite, and kunzite
Metals: Tin
Parts of the body: Thighs, hips, sacral region

Number four is associated with the planet Uranus, ruler of the sign Aquarius. Uranus is an eccentric planet in that its rotational axis almost falls in its plane of orbit (whereas most planets rotate along an axis roughly perpendicular to their planed will entertain any idea. They realize that new ideas are often rejected simply because they are unfamiliar to people, and that ideas accepted as "fact" today were rejected as crazy by earlier generations. Fours are attracted to the unusual, in people, in art, in music, in fashion -- in anything. They are intolerant of anything predictable.

People with this number judge others by their inner qualities alone. They are not impressed by status, power, or money, and they treat people of all walks of life equally. They are tolerant and do not expect others to share their views. They expect the same tolerance from others, and are annoyed by people who encourage them to behave more conventionally.

People with the number four often have exceptional intelligence, partly due to an openness to inspiration and partly due to cool rationality unfettered by emotionality or tradition. They are inventive and progressive, "ahead of their time." They make good scientists, inventors, and astrologers. Their lives tend to be full of sudden, unexpected changes that are temporarily disruptive but usually beneficial in the long run.

People with the number four welcome progressive changes in society, particularly those involving improved technology or better conditions for the underprivileged. You will never hear them reminiscing about "the good old days." They live in the future, and in fact they can usually see what the future looks like. Change does not surprise them or unsettle them. They realize that change is necessary for society to improve.

Fours can benefit from wearing bright blue stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Electric blue, cobalt blue
Chakra: Third eye (forehead)
Gems/Stones: Sapphire, lapis lazuli
Crystals: Quartz crystals and any bright blue ones, for example forms of linarite, sodalite, kyanite, and lazulite
Metals: Platinum, aluminum, uranium, radium
Parts of the body: Lower legs, ankles, blood vessels

Number five is associated with the planet Mercury, ruler of the sign Gemini. The nature of a number can often be discerned by studying words that contain the name of its associated planet or luminary, in this case Mercury. The word mercurial means ever- changing and flexible, flighty, fickle, erratic, and lively. Such are people with the number five. Five is an intellectual number, and people with this number are guided by thought much more than emotion or instinct. They attempt to understand everything through the intellect, and so they are often confused by their emotional reactions to people or situations and by physical drives. Confronted with anything or anyone new, they will try to penetrate the surface to "figure it out, " often with prying questions or by observing people's reactions to provocative statements or behaviour. Once they have satisfied themselves that they understand a person or situation, they become bored and restless and quickly move on. In love, they are always convinced that "the grass is greener on the other side." They tire of someone with whom they are intimate because their constant analysis of the person reveals their flaws. Other potential lovers who are sufficiently far away from them to fall outside the range of their critical gaze seem more appealing -- until they become intimate with them too and discover, to their great disappointment, human frailties in the new lover.

Fives are kaleidoscopic, constantly changing in behaviour, mood, and even appearance. They crave novelty and excitement. They often have multiple personalities that can be identified by those close to them. They are mentally quick and witty, always ready with a clever quip. They are forever youthful in spirit and often in appearance. They have considerable charm. They are extremely versatile, often displaying talent in several areas. They usually have a long list of hobbies which often includes writing of some sort. People with this number must learn to avoid doing too much, running on their nerves; such excess can lead to exhaustion, illness (especially bronchitis or other difficulties with the lungs and bronchi), or nervous breakdown.

People with the number five tend to over-analyze people and situations. They must learn to trust their feelings and intuitions more. Fives are extremely critical, especially of those closest to them, and they can shatter egos and wreak havoc in their relationships because of this tendency.

Fives can benefit from wearing light gray stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Silver, light gray, light green, azure blue
Chakras: Heart, throat
Gems/Stones: Aquamarine, emerald, agate
Crystals: Any gray ones, for example forms of smoky quartz, nepheline, thenardite, and barite; silvery metallic crystals suchas chalcocite, arsenopyrite, and skutterudite
Metals: Mercury (quicksilver)
Parts of the body: Shoulders, upper arms, hands, lungs, bronchi, central nervous system

Number six is associated with the planet Venus, ruler of the sign Libra. Venus is the goddess of love, and Sixes resonate to her frequency. They are charming and attractive, and they have a deep need to unite with a partner in love, and sometimes also in business. People with the number six are great diplomats and work to restore harmony in discordant social situations. They always try to be fair, trying to see both sides of any question. This trait sometimes causes them to argue for a position that they do not themselves hold, just so that every side is represented in the discussion. Their diplomatic nature often leads them to hide their true feelings to avoid discord; unfortunately, though, in doing so they often mislead people about their feelings or intentions.

Sixes love attention and flattery. If they are not constantly reminded of their charms, they feel unappreciated or even spurned. Fortunately, it is usually easy to find reason to flatter them, for they often radiate beauty, physical or otherwise. Sixes are polite and well-mannered unless something causes them to "lose their balance"; they can then become ill- tempered, fretful, or even hysterical, throwing an impressive "temper tantrum." Such fits usually occur when they are being ignored, especially when someone else is getting all the attention, leaving the six feeling jealous and deprived.

People with the number six are intellectual in nature, and love discussions in which they can flex their ability to construct an argument -- as long as the discussion is good-natured and calm. They make good lawyers or marriage counselors.

Sixes make friends easily because of their natural charm and charisma. They have a keen aesthetic sense and love beautiful, tasteful, harmonious surroundings. They love art, music and literature, especially the most refined. They hate vulgarity and ugliness. If they have money, they dress in the finest clothes, always choosing colours and cuts that suit them perfectly. Their natural attractiveness is enhanced by a beautiful, magical smile. In love, they are romantic, sentimental, affectionate, and devoted.

Sixes can benefit from wearing pale blue or pink stones or crystals and copper next to the body.

Colours: Turquoise blue, pastel blue, sky blue, pink, rose
Chakra: Throat
Gems/Stones: Turquoise, opals, sapphires, pink or blue spinel
Crystals: Any pale blue ones, such as forms of benitoite, lazulite, fluorite, vivianite, barite, indicolite (tourmaline), and linarite; pink ones such as rose quartz, lepidolite, inesite, thulite (zoisite), and forms of rhodochrosite, kunzite(spodumene), and muscovite
Metals: Copper
Parts of the body: Lower back, kidneys, veins, ovaries

Number seven is associated with the planet Neptune, ruler of the sign Pisces. Sevens tend to be spiritual, deeply emotional, sensitive, easily hurt, and easily confused by practical matters (which are of little interest to them). They have a rich fantasy life, and they are often disappointed when real life does not match their dreams in beauty, wonder, and magic. They are idealists. Their minds are open to inspiration, and they receive most of their knowledge and wisdom in this way. They have a deep understanding of human nature, and can identify with any form of human suffering. For this reason, they make wonderful listeners. Unfortunately for them, people often take advantage of this ability and burden them heavily with their problems. But Sevens will accept the burden, be deeply moved, and then quietly slip away to be alone and restore themselves to harmony. They absorb the emotions of others, and so they often need solitude to feel calm and centred.

Sevens are private and will usually evade prying questions. They only share their dreams and plans with the most positive and trustworthy of friends. They realize that most people are negative and will warn them of all kinds of potential dangers inherent in their plans for the future, or laugh at their unconventional and apparently impractical plans. They know intuitively that thoughts and words have great power in influencing situations, and they don't want negative people sending out all those negative vibes about their hopes and dreams! So they keep their plans secret, or share them with a few especially gentle friends who will, like them, have faith in the magic of their dreams.

People with this number often find reality too harsh, and tend towards escapism. The escape can take many forms: alcohol, drugs, dark nightclubs, abandonment to sex, religious devotion, or protection and support from others. Sevens are, at their best, creative and inspired, and they should avoid the tendency to escapism and use their talents to benefit the world. Their very presence in the world makes life easier for the rest of us. They are always gentle and kindly, and they are sensitive to the needs of others (except, perhaps, when their needs have been denied for too long). They are masters at soothing the pain and sorrow of others (but poor at easing their own pain). They need a life with structure so that they do not drift aimlessly, but one in which their imagination and creativity can flow so that they will not feel stifled.

People with the number seven are extremely intuitive, even psychic. They don't need practical knowledge to make their way through the world because they can "feel" their way through. They have a magical guidance system that lands them in the right place at the right time, that is if they listen to it and ignore the suggestions or demands of others. They must learn to trust their inner voice, for it comes from a place of truth and beauty. It can teach them mysteries that are unavailable to others.

Sevens can benefit from wearing deep green, blue-green, or purple stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Sea green, aquamarine blue, violet, mauve and lavender
Chakra: Crown of the head
Gems/Stones: Amethyst, emeralds, aquamarine, coral
Crystals: Any green or blue-green ones, for example forms of hiddenite(spodumene), vesuvianite, olivenite, torbernite, green garnet(grossular or uvarovite), willemite, malachite, brochantite, elbaite(tourmaline), calcite, scapolite, fluorite, chrysocolla, apophyllite, amazonite (orthoclase), and vivianite; purplish ones such as amethystand forms of apatite, fluorite, and kunzite (spodumene)
Metals: Tin
Part of the body: Feet

Number eight is associated with the planet Saturn, ruler of the sign Capricorn. People with this number tend to be serious, cautious,  hard-working, and disciplined. Their humour is dry and subtle. They are ambitious and work steadily toward their goals, letting nothing stop them. They can plan for decades ahead, and so their achievements are often considerable. They have the patience and stamina necessary to achieve their ambitions. Eights are often very reserved, and they find it difficult to let loose and have fun. In later life, they may discover that it is okay to drop the reserve and enjoy themselves. They have difficulty expressing affection, and so they are often perceived as rather cold. Inside they are affectionate and warm, and they should learn that it's okay to show it. They will be less lonely if they do. In love, they are faithful and dependable.

People with this number have a sturdy constitution and often remain healthy well into old age. Life often starts out very difficult for eights, but improves over time. Old age is their most fortunate time. Eights demand much of themselves (and others), but their willingness to meet those demands guarantees that their rewards will be great when they finally arrive. People with the number eight have tremendous inner strength and determination. Nothing comes to them by chance, but only by their single-mindedness, hard work, and careful planning. They can thus realize success for even the largest projects.

Eights often obtain positions of responsibility and play an important role in society. They are often instrumental in teaching others important karmic lessons, especially those involving responsibility. These people have tremendous self- control and self-discipline and can thrive in a highly structured environment (such as military life). They never shirk duty and have no fear of hard work. They prefer the familiar and the predictable to the novel, and they like routine in their lives.

Eights can benefit from wearing diamonds and dark brown or black stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Dark brown, navy blue, steel gray, black
Chakra: Base of the spine
Gems/Stones: Diamonds, onyx
Crystals: Any dark brown ones, such as forms of titanite (sphene), zircon, descloizite, almandine (garnet), melanite (garnet), dravite (tourmaline), apatite, barite, rutile, and axinite; black ones, for example forms of spinel, schorl (tourmaline), almandine (garnet), descloizite, augite, melanite (garnet), hornblende, cassiterite, titanite (sphene), hedenbergite, augite, acmite, neptunite, smoky quartz, and riebeckite

Number nine is associated with the planet Mars, ruler of the sign Aries. People with the number nine are impulsive, impatient, daring and quick. They love adventures of all sizes and kinds, from trying a new kind of food to travelling into outer space. They need to be first at anything they do, and become angry and hurt if they cannot. They expect quick results, and they do not have the patience to see things through to completion, at least not at the level of fine detail. They find little comfort in the familiar, preferring new conquests -- in friendship, in love, in career, in anything. They are shrewd in business and wonderful organizers. They should have partners or employees, though, to take care of the boring details.

Nines tend to see the world in black and white. You are either their friend or their enemy. You are either terrific or awful. Everything is categorized according to extremes. They can turn a blind eye, at least for a while, to all kinds of horrible situations or nasty traits in people in order to maintain their vision of something or someone as wonderful. They can also miss the good in something or someone because they have decided that thing or person is horrible. It takes quite a bit of reality counter to their expectations for something to be re-categorized.

Nines are often viewed as immature because of their naive belief that they can get anything they want, and their angry reactions when they find they can't. People with this number have a reputation for being self-centred. In reality, they can be very giving and generous -- often to a fault. They become very hurt, though, if their generosity is not fully appreciated. They are self-centred in the sense that they are not aware of the needs of others, but they will go out of their way to help someone if that person's needs are made known to them. People need to express their needs and desires to nines in a very explicit way, for nines are not sensitive to subtle hints or body language. They do not analyze people's behaviour to discover their motives or penetrate their personality, but instead take situations at face value, believing what they like. They are dismayed by any dishonesty or deviousness; they themselves are always very direct, without guile, and they naively expect the same from others. This expectation makes them too trusting, and they are easy prey for those who practice manipulation and deceit.

Nines can be fun and exciting company. They find delight in life's smallest pleasures, and their enthusiasm is infectious. They want everything to happen fast, and are very impatient with people who are mentally or physically slow. They become extremely irritable if kept waiting. They are masters at the art of complaining, which is often done with humour. They have a quick temper that flares up instantly but then dies down almost as quickly. They are shocked if people do not immediately forgive and forget any offence, even though they themselves sometimes carry grudges. They often offend people (usually without knowing it) because they speak before they think, careless of the consequences. They are hurt and confused whenever people are offended, and will happily apologize if given the chance. Unfortunately, many people assume that the offense was intentional, and they feel enmity towards the nine. People with this number often leave a trail of anger and opposition behind them.

People with the number nine are courageous and sometimes even thrive on danger. They like to "live on the edge." They love excitement and lots of activity. They need attention and become depressed if ignored. At the same time, they hate people who cling to them because they dislike any restrictions or responsibilities that block their opportunities for spontaneity and impulsiveness.

Behind the brave image, nines often lack confidence. They need constant and explicit reassurances that they are appreciated, without which they cannot feel loved or respected.

Nines can benefit from wearing red stones or crystals next to the body.

Colours: Red, crimson, magenta
Chakra: Base of the spine
Gems/Stones: Rubies, red hematite (bloodstone), red garnet, rhodonite
Crystals: Any red ones, for example forms of almandine (garnet), cuprite, rhodocrosite, vanadinite, hematite, sphalerite, zincite, pyrargyrite, corundum (ruby), rubellite (tourmaline), and proustite
Metals: Iron
