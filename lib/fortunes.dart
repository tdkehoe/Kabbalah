  10: "Number ten is associated with the tarot card known as the Wheel of Fortune. This is a powerful number, for those who possess it have the ability to bring about whatever they will to be. The ups and downs of life are self-determined by conscious or unconscious acts of will. The name will be known, whether for good or for evil. Tens arouse extremes of feeling in others, either love or hate, and either respect or fear. To avoid tragedy, tens must realize their power and use it for good.",
  11: "Number eleven is associated with the tarot card known as Strength. The individual with this number must overcome many difficulties, for the life is full of hidden dangers, trials, and treachery from other people. There are always two opposed situations in conflict, or at least the illusion of separateness. The divided goals must be united somehow. Some external force (idea or person) may interfere, blocking a resolution of the conflict. The two forces or desires must be reconciled, with each being allowed to remain in existence, but with the two joined into a union. Otherwise the conflicts will prevent action and nothing will be accomplished. People with this number are often encouraged to change their name or use a different version of the name, one that is more fortunate.",
  12: "Number twelve is associated with the tarot card known as The Hanged Man. This is the number of sacrifice. Twelves will often be required to sacrifice their own needs in order to assist others, and they will often have to sacrifice something in order to achieve their own goals. Others often fail to look after the needs of people with this number, and may even use manipulation to achieve their ends. Beware of false flattery or empty promises. Twelves are often victimized, and in early life there is much suffering and anxiety. They must develop spiritually to overcome this pattern. The number twelve represents the submission to a teacher necessary for true learning, and twelves must accept such submission, especially with spiritual teachers. This is a spiritual number, and happiness will only come when physical and intellectual desires are sacrificed to spiritual needs. Contemplation will bring the necessary illumination.",
  13: "Number thirteen is associated with the tarot card known as Death. Physical death is really just a transformation into another state of being, and the message of this tarot card relates to transformations, not to endings. This is a number of upheaval. Progress occurs by giving up the old in favour of the new and superior. The ancients used the snake as a symbol for wisdom because its periodic shedding of its skin symbolizes well the abandonment of the old that is necessary to acquire wisdom. Old beliefs, values and behaviour must be relinquished to achieve growth. There will be encounters with the unknown and unexpected which must be met with adaptive change. A willingness to learn by this means bring great power, which should be used wisely. The person has the power to transform others, often without their conscious knowledge. This is the number of the genius, the explorer, the destroyer of orthodoxy, and the discoverer.",
  14: "Number fourteen is associated with the tarot card known as The Alchemist or Temperance. Fourteens can communicate with the public through writing or the media in a magnetic way. This is the number of constant movement and change. Fourteens must exercise caution, for they are open to risk and danger due to the foolhardiness or deceit of others. They should not allow themselves to be influenced by others, always listening only to the self. This is the true number of incarnation because the soul carries with it no memory of previous incarnations in physical bodies. Fourteens must master the art of combination (of people and things) in order to succeed. With caution and prudence, they can do well in speculation, finance, and business. Any tendency to degrade sex to lust, passion, and self-gratification should be avoided. Sex should be raised to the level of love, enthusiasm, affection, and devotion. There may be some danger of accidents from natural forces (e.g., fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods), but this is less likely if an inner balance can be achieved even in the face of external change and upheaval. Great benefit can come from facing one's dark side (what Jung called \"The Shadow\") and learning to use the energy that sustains the dark (unconscious and destructive) behaviours for good -- for spreading love and light (illumination). This is the true alchemy.",
  15: "Number fifteen is associated with the tarot card known as The Devil. This card represents an attitude of fatalism that prevents people from taking action and changing their lives. When the causes of situations are externalized, blamed on others or on a cold, unfeeling world, tragedy rules the life. Success can only come through the realization that we create our lives, consciously or otherwise. The control lies ultimately with us. Fifteens have tremendous power to control, and they must avoid the temptation to use that power for selfish or destructive ends. They have a strong personal magnetism that attracts others to them easily. They have no trouble obtaining money, gifts, and favours from people. They are good talkers with a sense of drama, and they are often gifted musicians or artists. Their sensuality is obvious to others. This is the number of the enchanter. The less developed with this number will be tempted to use black magic, hypnotism, or any other means to carry out their purpose. This is a temptation to be avoided, for we reap what we sow. That is a universal law. Success and happiness can be obtained only by looking after the needs of everyone involved. They will not come at the expense of others, for we are all part of one another. To hurt another is to hurt oneself. Fifteens must operate according to the golden rule or their lives will become progressively more chaotic.",
  16: "Number sixteen is associated with the tarot card known as The Tower. In quabbalistic numerology, it is called The Shattered Citadel. It warns of downfall and destruction as the consequence of any evil or lack of enlightenment. To avoid tragedy, the person with this number must actively seek out wisdom and illumination and follow a spiritual path religiously. Glory and victory will follow. Otherwise, the person is prone to accidents, catastrophes, defeat, and disappointments. The person may meet a strange fate. An evil fate can be avoided by paying serious attention to dreams or visions that provide premonitions of danger. The person must then take steps to avoid the danger. Sixteens can also avoid downfall by accepting a humble place in society. They must not lust after power, high position, or fame, for the higher they go the further they will fall, especially if their climb is facilitated by evil of any kind. They must exercise caution, planning every detail, to avoid unforeseen disaster. People with this number are advised to change their name or use a different version of their name.",
  17: "Number seventeen is associated with the tarot card known as The Star. In quabbalistic numerology, it is called The Star of the Magi, Path of the Realization, or Reward of the Righteous. This is a very spiritual number. People with this number overcome trials and difficulties in life and in career, rising above such troubles in spirit. The name will live on, and the bearer of the name is immortal in this sense. This is the number of truth, faith, and hope. Seventeens have executive ability and succeed financially. They are wise in practical matters. Their intuition is powerful. They are capable of achieving beauty of expression. This number is very fortunate, although good fortune comes only after conquering many difficulties.",
  18: "Number eighteen is associated with the tarot card known as The Moon. People with this number are tested by an inner battle between materialism and spirituality. Success can come only by following the spiritual path. The life is full of bitter quarrels, sometimes within the family. There is much strife, fighting, and revolt. Sometimes money and position can come through war or other types of conflict. Beware of deception and treachery by others. There is a danger from storms, floods, fires, electrical shock, lightning, and explosions. Eighteens should exercise caution and be on their guard. Some have a talent for healing and make good doctors; some make good lawyers. The higher side of eighteen is justice, truth, and spirituality. The lower side is materialism. Eighteens have mediumistic ability, being highly intuitive. People with this number are either very good or very bad, very balanced or very unbalanced. Eighteen is associated with genius but also with insanity. It is depravity versus nobility. Eighteens should be aware that their fate in this incarnation is to be tested of worthiness through temptation. (This is the number of the names Jesus, Christ, and Jesus Christ.) Success and happiness can come only through strict adherence to a spiritual path. Every evil directed against eighteens must be met with love, forgiveness, kindness, and honesty. They must turn the other cheek. Only then can they triumph.",
  19: "Number nineteen is associated with the tarot card known as The Sun. In quabbalistic numerology, it is called The Prince of Heaven. This is one of the most fortunate compound numbers. People with this number will rise victorious over all failure and disappointment. Nineteens have tremendous power to control situations through acts of will, and they are not tempted to misuse this power. They find happiness, fulfillment, and success in every area of life. They receive esteem and honour.",
  20: "Number twenty is associated with the tarot card known as Judgment. In quabbalistic numerology, it is called The Awakening. At some time in the life there will be a powerful awakening (or enlightenment) leading to new plans, a new purpose in life, new ambitions. There will be a call to action for some great cause or purpose. Twenties may experience some delays, obstacles, and hindrances to plans which can be conquered through spiritual development, patience, and faith in their ability to transform situations. People with this number have dreams that foretell the future. Moreover, they can prevent the negative ones from coming true. Twenties may not achieve financial success, but this is not their highest priority. Spiritual matters concern them more.",
  21: "Number twenty-one is associated with the tarot card known as The World or The Universe. In quabbalistic numerology, it is called The Crown of the Magi. This number foretells victory after a long battle. There is elevation in life and success. Artistic and musical talent are often present. Twenty-ones are happy-go-lucky, and material things may slip away from them. They attain power, advancement, honour, awards, and general good fortune. This number represents the supreme success of the human soul, the union of wisdom and love at the end of a path of human effort, realizing perfection and a job well done. But the success comes only after a long struggle, an initiation, with much testing of the soul. Determination is needed, but fortune eventually arrives.",
  22: "Number twenty-two is associated with the tarot card known as The Fool. This number warns of delusion and illusion, of living in a fool's paradise. Twenty-twos are dreamers, and they awaken from the dream only when confronted with danger. Their judgment is poor, often because they place faith in people who are not trustworthy. People with this number should exercise caution and vigilance. They should not be lazy with a \"come what may\" attitude, but should instead approach life with the knowledge that they can change situations through acts of will. Through envisioning success and willing it to arrive, they can prevent the failure that would otherwise come to them through their own foolishness or the foolishness of advisors.",
  23: "Number twenty-three is called The Royal Star of the Lion in quabbalistic numerology. This number brings success, help from superiors, protection from powerful people, and fame. Twenty-threes are clever and quick-witted. They learn easily and are gifted speakers and writers. They are daring, and even their most daring plans are carried out successfully. They receive great opportunities and succeed in taking advantage of them. This is one of the best compound numbers.",
  24: "Number twenty-four brings gain through the opposite sex. People with this number associate with people of rank and position who assist them in their plans. There is some danger of falls, for example from a horse or motorcycle. Twenty-fours achieve financial success and happiness in love. They gain through romance, legal matters, or the arts. They have a magnetism that attracts members of the opposite sex. They are prone to self-indulgence and arrogance in romance, finance, and career because things come to them with such little effort. They should not take their good fortune for granted or it may be taken away from them. They should resist the temptation toward selfishness, materialism, promiscuity, and over-indulgence.",
  25: "Number twenty-five brings strong intuitions, psychic flashes, and prophetic dreams. Strife and trials in early life are overcome through wisdom that comes from careful observation and analysis. The spiritual wisdom gained in this way can be used to learn from experience and avoid repetitions of the same mistakes. Twenty-fives can become masters of the mysteries, but they must not be tempted to turn to black magic, which always brings evil upon the self. People with this number find comfort in nature. They are safe on water and good swimmers. Through developing spiritually and attaining wisdom, they come to have excellent judgment.",
  26: "Number twenty-six brings strength through control, experience, and wisdom. Twenty-sixes make good diplomats or members of the secret service. They are energetic and compelling speakers. They tend to prosper at the material level. This number warns of disasters or loss of money due to unsuccessful partnerships. There may also be danger from burglars, racketeers and criminals, and from evil and treachery. Ruin may come through bad speculations, partnerships, unions, and bad advice. Number twenty-six brings leadership and the power to control others. Twenty-sixes are self- confident, sometimes due to some unusual event. They are compassionate and unselfish, wonderful at helping others but not so good at helping the self. They should avoid partnerships, pursuing their goals on their own. They should not heed the advice of others, even from well-meaning people. They should instead follow their own instincts and intuitions, and even then only after careful consideration. Twenty-sixes are advised to save money, investing in their own future rather than in other people's schemes.",
  27: "Number twenty-seven is called The Sceptre in quabbalistic numerology. It brings power in public places, and independence in thought and action. Twenty-sevens have a desire to help others in any possible way. The intellect is creative, and there is a love of peace, justice, beauty, and art. People with this number are sometimes intolerant or bigoted. This number guarantees authority, power, and command. Creativity and productive labour pay off with large rewards. Twenty-sevens should ignore other people's plans and ideas and follow their own ones, even in the face of opposition or contrary opinions. They can do so with courage, and success is almost inevitably their reward. This is a most fortunate number.",
  28: "People with the number twenty-eight must plan carefully for the future, saving money as a cushion against loss. Twenty-eights often show great promise and possibility, and they may even achieve great success for some time, but they are in danger of having everything taken away from them. Loss usually comes through placing trust in the wrong people, or from the opposition of enemies or competitors in commerce or career. There may even be losses through the courts. These people may have to pick themselves up and start again repeatedly. To guard against possible losses, twenty-eights must learn the lessons of caution and prudence, planning every step, acquiring adequate insurance, and setting aside money for the hard times. People with this number are often advised to change their name or use a different version of the name, one that resonates to a more fortunate number.",
  29: "Twenty-nine is a very difficult number. It brings uncertainties, treachery, and deception from others. The life is full of trials and tribulations, with unexpected dangers. Friends are unreliable, and lovers are deceitful and bring grief. The life is a test of spiritual strength, much like that of Job in the old testament. The cure for the problems that are associated with this number is to cultivate a strong faith in goodness in the universe and in one's own power to bring about good through acts of will. Optimism is required even in the face of extreme adversity. Remember how Job's trials ended, and he was rewarded with great prosperity. The key is to realize that YOU are responsible for the situations you encounter. Your past actions (perhaps in previous lives) and your conscious or subconscious fears, worries, grudges, hatreds and misguided desires attract to you any negative circumstances in which you find yourself. You must learn not to blame others for your troubles, but to accept each problem as an opportunity to learn and to repay a debt (perhaps incurred in a previous incarnation). Bitterness and anger will only ensure that you continue to attract trouble. Adopt an attitude of love and forgiveness, of wanting to learn from experience, of acceptance of whatever comes to you, and maintain a strong faith in universal justice. By this means, your troubles will eventually disappear and what is wanting will be replaced with bounty. You might also consider changing the name or using a different version of your name, one that has a more fortunate number.",
  30: "Thirty is an intellectual number, and it is neither fortunate nor unfortunate. The fortune depends on the mental outlook and desire. It can be all-powerful or indifferent, depending on the attitude and the use of the will. People with this number tend not to be materialistic, and for this reason children and animals. The number thirty is associated with drugs, chemistry, anatomy, and medicine, and so people with this number can be skillful physicians or surgeons. Thirties engage in retrospection and thoughtful deduction. They have few close friends, preferring to be alone with their thoughts. Their lives are kept private. They feel uncomfortable at social functions or public gatherings, partly because the conversation tends to be superficial in groups. Fulfillment can be found by applying the intelligence to some worthwhile project designed to benefit the world, by writing about ideas that can change the world, or by using one's artistic talent to create works that lift up the spirit. The lifestyle of thirties is lonely, but it can also be very rewarding.",
  31: "Number thirty-one describes a person who is self-contained, self-sufficient, lonely and isolated. Genius can be present, or at least high intelligence. Thirty-ones often, at some point in life, reject the world for solitude in nature; it is the number of the hermit. At least some sort of retreat from society is likely. People with this number are quite fixed in their own habits, but they advocate change for society and have strong opinions. They can feel isolated and lonely even in a crowd, strongly aware of their differences from others.",
  32: "Thirty-two is a magical number, giving charisma, magnetism, and protection from people in power. The greatest fortune comes by trusting one's own judgment and opinions; otherwise, one's plans are likely to be ruined by the stupidity or stubbornness of others. Thirty-twos have many friends and business connections. They can converse on any subject. They are eloquent and can learn new languages easily. Their possible weakness is a lack of spirituality and loose morals. They can master the intricacies of writing, publishing, advertising, and broadcasting with little effort. They work well under pressure. This is a very fortunate number.",
  33: "Number thirty-three is similar to the number twenty-four, except that the ability to attract love and money are increased, and so in the extent of the creativity and originality. Partnerships with the opposite sex bring added good fortune, whether in love or business. These people often have some incredible good fortune fall upon them at some time in their lives. They must be careful not to take it for granted, to become lazy, or to feel superior. It is important to maintain a sense of humour and humility.",
  34: "Number thirty-four is similar to the number twenty-five. It also indicates a life full of secrets and mystery. These people are intuitive and may have occult interests. They tend to be retiring and gentle. They are strongly religious or spiritual, and are not rebellious or disobedient.",
  35: "People with the number thirty-five often inherit money and can live comfortably. They enjoy travel. They must be careful not to let the ease of their lives allow them to become cruel or tyrannical. They are usually friendly and helpful. They advance without much effort and success comes to them quite easily.",
  36: "Number thirty-six brings authority, power and success if the talents are used well. Thirty-sixes are generous, kind and sympathetic. They are easily upset, and have many ups and downs in life.",
  37: "The thirty-seven nature is extremely sensitive. There will be good and fortunate friendships and partnerships of all kinds. These people have a strong magnetism with the public, often in the arts. Love and romance are emphasised, and there may be too much emphasis on sex. Sometimes they have unconventional attitudes in this area. They have a strong need for harmony in relationships. Success and happiness come most easily when in partnerships, both in love and in business or career.",
  38: "Number thirty-eight can be associated with quarrels, misunderstandings, and separations. It is a powerful number spiritually. What harmony is found will be great, but when disharmony occurs there will be lies, deceit, and falsehood.",
  39: "Number thirty-nine brings good health, longevity, friendship and love. These people can live best in the southwest. This number can go either way -- cruelty and suffering, or great heights. (See also the number 30.)",
  40: "Forties are careful with money and may be very methodical in living their lives. They may be involved with printing or literature in some way. They can be generous with others, rarely being selfish. They can have success in business or in any literary profession, and may have mathematical talent. They make good investors.",
  41: "Number forty-one is similar to the 32. These people can usually obtain what they desire, and can keep harm away. They are in control of their passions.",
  42: "Forty-twos may be strongly religious. They can help others immensely. They can be artistic, and may have talent in singing in particular. There may be baseness and treachery. In extreme cases, a violent death can occur.",
  43: "Number forty-three symbolises revolution, upheaval, strife, failure and prevention. The life may be connected to military activity. There may be danger from war and firearms. Victory can be obtained only through positive action. There may be repeated disappointment and failure. People with this number should considered changing their name or using a different version of their name.",
  44: "Forty-four is a number of bravery and success in practical undertakings. In political and military pursuits, these people will find glory. If the desire for fame is too great, there may be personal loss. Either hoarding or acquiring too much can also lead to loss. Forty-fours must exercise self-control and know when to stop.",
  45: "People with the number forty-five love to teach, to serve, and to help others. They punish wickedness but lift up those in distress and crisis. They prepare for emergencies. They often marry and have children early. They usually involve themselves in groups and organizations working toward some noble goal. This number brings power in public places, and independence in thought and action. The intellect is creative, and there is a love of peace, justice, beauty, and art. People with this number are sometimes intolerant or bigoted. This number guarantees authority, power, and command. Creativity and productive labour pay off with large rewards. Forty-fives should ignore other people's plans and ideas and follow their own ones, even in the face of opposition or contrary opinions. They can do so with courage, and success is almost inevitably their reward. This is a most fortunate number.",
