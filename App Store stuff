Kabbalah Numerology

Description
Discover the hidden power of your name!

Medieval Jewish rabbis developed the mystical knowledge known as Kabbalah to find hidden meanings in the Torah. Now an iPhone app shows you the fortune associated with your name. It's useful if you're considering changing your name, using a different version of your name, or naming a baby.
